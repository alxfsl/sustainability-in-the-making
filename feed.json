This PhD, however, looks at sustainable craft from a different perspective, which sees craft and making as social activities through which people share, transform, and create cultural values, like preserving traditions, building local identities, sharing worldviews, creating a sense of place or collective histories.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/heritage-craft-bovey-tracey-1.webp\" height=\"2149\" width=\"1608\" alt=\"Watercolour and ink drawing of a man weaving a willow basket\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/heritage-craft-bovey-tracey-1-xs.webp 300w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/heritage-craft-bovey-tracey-1-sm.webp 480w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/heritage-craft-bovey-tracey-1-md.webp 768w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/heritage-craft-bovey-tracey-1-xl.webp 1200w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/heritage-craft-bovey-tracey-1-xxl.webp 1600w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/heritage-craft-bovey-tracey-1-xxxl.webp 1920w\">\n      <figcaption>Alessandra Fasoli © 2023.

Maker craft communities in Devon and the Southwest are fluid, active, and resilient communities, whose connection with the territory runs deep.  I decided then to take a broader social and cultural perspective, which led to the current title and approach&nbsp;<em>Sustainability in the Making: Craft Programmes for Socio-Ecological Change</em>.&nbsp;It looks more broadly at craft-led sustainability initiatives and programmes in the Southwest, which may or may not be also makerspace-based or makerspace-driven. \n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/makerspace.webp\" height=\"1079\" width=\"1417\" alt=\"Digital drawing of people working in a makerspace\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/makerspace-xs.webp 300w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/makerspace-sm.webp 480w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/makerspace-md.webp 768w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/makerspace-xl.webp 1200w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/makerspace-xxl.webp 1600w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/makerspace-xxxl.webp 1920w\">\n      <figcaption>Alessandra Fasoli © 2020.

Their house was full of objects that they made themselves. Despite enjoying this time, I grew up wondering why they were spending so much time making stuff, when they could go to the shop and buy it. It was not until much later, that I understood that for my grandparents, who migrated to Rome from an isolated rural village in Sicily, making was a matter of identity, not of economy.<code></code></blockquote>\n      <figcaption> \tFasoli, Alex (2023) Making as culture : people, places, practices, and sustainability change.

Alessandra Fasoli, 2022 © All rights reserved. </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    In February 2022 I participated to the <a href=\"https://makesouthwest.org.uk/green-maker-initiative\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Green Maker Initiative</a> launch event, organised by MAKE Southwest and University of Plymouth’s <a href=\"https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/sustainability-hub-low-carbon-devon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Low Carbon Devon</a>. This was the first in-person event related to my research, and the aim was knowing the community of makers that revolve around MAKE Southwest, generating interest around my research and collecting informal impressions about sustainability and craft. My participation to the event has been the first step in mapping creative craft and maker ecologies in South Devon, as part of my research project to understand how they work and organise themselves from a sustainability point of view.\n<br>\n<br>Finding the right way to approach the community and establish a conversation arises a series of questions, especially in the beginning, where unknowns and uncertainties are high.\n<br>In my experience, the biggest problem with ‘sustainable practices’ is that everyone has their own idea on what ‘sustainable’ means, and craft and maker communities inherit this heterogeneity due to the vagueness of the original concept of sustainability.\n<br>\n<br>As I explain <a href=\"https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/craft-sustainability-and-makerspaces-a-brief-intro-to-my-research/\">here</a>, my research focuses on understanding making as a meaning-building process that can help in building sustainability cultures. Defining making as a cultural enabler implies that people relates to making and making relate to people depending on a series of ecological factors like affordability, accessibility, subjectivity, collective practices, skills, and affordances. It also implies that what making means is at the same time contextual (i.e. it is influenced by the environment where making happens), and subjective (i.e. every person engaging in making - whether by actively becoming a maker or not - creates their own meaning around their practice). It also means than when we want to connect making and sustainability we need to look beyond the ‘product’, understanding first how environmental values influence making practices, and then exploring making as a way to forge environmental identities and create cultures of sustainability. In the context of my research, the way environmental values influence making translates into the question: ‘How is craft perceived in relation to sustainability values in South Devon?’ The launch of the GMI represented a very nice occasion for me, an outsider still trying to know the Devon communities, to get in contact with craftspeople and start conversation about craft and sustainability, and the people of MAKE Southwest were very supportive in allowing me to participate in the event and giving me a proper place where I could have some conversation with the makers and more in general with the people attending the event.\n<br>\n<br>Having it sorted in terms of logistics, my biggest challenge was creating a safe space for attendees to express themselves while gathering impressions in a way that it translates into useful information for my research. Building on my personal experience as a designer and a creative person, I decided that the best way would have been to create a recreative activity that was at the same time funny and relaxing, and what’s more relaxing than colouring?\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/25/participating-in-the-survey.webp\" height=\"3024\" width=\"3024\" alt=\"Picture of hands of two participants in the exploratory research colouring the icons of the survey to give their reponse.\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/25/responsive/participating-in-the-survey-xs.webp 300w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/25/responsive/participating-in-the-survey-sm.webp 480w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/25/responsive/participating-in-the-survey-md.webp 768w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/25/responsive/participating-in-the-survey-xl.webp 1200w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/25/responsive/participating-in-the-survey-xxl.webp 1600w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/25/responsive/participating-in-the-survey-xxxl.webp 1920w\">\n      <figcaption>Alessandra Fasoli © 2022. Green Maker Launch Event, 2022: Two participants colouring the icons on a survey sheet</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    The second challenge were the questions. They needed to be simple, understandable, but at the same time precise enough to give me the information I wanted. Luckily, many researchers have found themselves in similar situation, and framework are out there to be used. I decided to base this explorative activity on the Quadruple Bottom Line, though adjusted to my investigation. I set up the criteria through which I wanted investigate the meanings underlying making exploring 4 different values:\n<br>\n<br>    personal\n<br>    practical\n<br>    social\n<br>    environmental\n<br>\n<br>The people participating in the inquiry were both makers and buyers, and, therefore I created two different surveys for the two categories, and 25 people participated in the activity throughout the entire event, basically resulting in a constant flow of people sharing their views. I was surprised and pleased to see such a high response and sensibility to sustainability discourse, which confirmed my impression that there is a general interest in the topic and a will to do something in that direction. Despite my worries of maintaining the questions as general as possible, people were eager to share their practice and methods they were engaging with for rendering their practice more sustainable, leaving comments on the survey and telling me about their experience while they were filling the questions. As expected there are some fluctuations in the way the different values inform the way people relate to craft, and 25 people are certainly a small number to be representative of communities in South Devon. However, the experience itself offered some glimpses of possible trends. In particular, making is mostly perceived as a solo activity in regard to the creative process, but it acquires a social dimension in regard of the finished artefacts and the meanings it assumes once it is out in the world. Another interesting point regard material flows: makers showed a high level of confidence about the origin of their materials, but this information seems not to reach the buyers, though it is not clear if it is because of lack of transparency from the makers or because of a lack of interest from the buyers. As the research is ongoing and this was mostly an icebreaking activity, these suggestions must be taken anywhere with care.\n<br>What can be drawn from here that there is a group of people engaging with craft that not only has an interest into sustainability, but wants to actively do something in that regard. A full report of this activity will be integrated in my final dissertation. The results of this little survey will be the ground to which I’d like to plan some co-design activity with MAKE Southwest and their community.

            "content_html": "<p>In 2019, I started a PhD on craft for sustainable behaviour at <u><a href=\"https://www.kingston.ac.uk/faculties/kingston-school-of-art/\">Kingston School of Art London</a></u>.\n<em>Craft in Makerspaces: The Potential for Social Change for Sustainability</em> (working title) is an <a href=\"http://www.techne.ac.uk/for-students/techne-students/techne-students/techne-students-2019-20/fasoli\">AHRC-funded project</a> done in partnership with the <a href=\"https://www.craftscouncil.org.uk/\">Crafts Council</a>. It explores how cultures of making contribute to social sustainability and aims to gain insights for community craft-led initiatives to be actively integrated in sustainability policies. </p><p>This research expands <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14606925.2017.1352819\">my previous studies about the social role of makerspaces</a>, sometimes called hackerspaces or fab labs, which are a network of community open workshops that emerged and spread globally since the 2000s. Their dissemination generated a maker movement based on sharing tools, knowledge, and practices. Although they might not have an explicit sustainability mission, makerspace communities promote DIY practices, repairability, recycling, and reuse of objects, while the adoption of digital fabrication technologies like 3d printing or CNC milling machines led to the concept of <em><a href=\"https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/the-factory-everywhere-the-present-and-future-of-distributed-manufacturing/\">distributed manufacturing</a></em>, which advocates for a more local and custom production of objects.<br>Being often described as revolutionary and breakthrough, these approaches focus on products and production by answering the questions on <em>how</em> and <em>where</em> things are made, but leave aside <em>why</em> and <em>what</em> things are made, that instead inquiry the cultural significance of artefacts. Culture plays a crucial role in sustainability, as they inform behaviours, consumers’ choices, and production systems. In mass manufactured products and production, cultural values are mostly hidden: like for example, in a cheap sweater. They however become evident in craft objects, like a hand-knitted jumper by your mum, where the value of the family relationship is transferred and embedded in the jumper, and the time, care, and inventiveness in creating it give to the artefact a special meaning.</p><p>Craft practices have then retained a cultural affection and reconnect us with the material world in a more direct, sometimes nostalgic, way. <a href=\"https://www.craftscouncil.org.uk/learning/participation/what-we-learned-from-co-creating-in-makerspaces\">Makerspaces gave craft a new opportunity</a> to claim back its social dimension through public engagement in making, increased using digital platforms. In both physical and digital maker communities it is the practice of making, not artefacts, that is shaping and strengthening the relationship between the members of these communities, and between communities and their environment. Considering its shared cultural value, craft can then be an important tool to create sustainability cultures. </p><p>After a first stage of exploring the cultural meaning of craft, makerspaces, and social sustainability, my project is now investigating what <em>craft in makerspaces</em> means for communities in Devon, where I live, and where there is an active sustainability-oriented maker tradition. This is a participatory process through which the local maker communities are actively helping me to build a map of Devon making ecologies and understand how they are contributing to enhance a social sustainable behaviour. \nHowever, for craft practices to have a meaningful impact in building environmental cultures, they need to be integrated into more structural sustainability strategies. The final goal of this project is to have an outcome that points in this direction, a toolkit for stakeholders to promote and improve craft-led sustainability change.</p><p><em>A <a href=\"https://www.craftscouncil.org.uk/about/research-and-policy/march-2022/craft-in-makerspaces\">shorter version</a> of this article has been featured in the Crafts Council’s Research Updates in March 2022.</em></p><hr>\n<p>This version was originally published on <a href=\"https://alxfsl.com/sustainability-in-the-making/craft-sustainability-and-makerspaces-a-brief-intro-to-my-research\">https://alxfsl.com/sustainability-in-the-making/craft-sustainability-and-makerspaces-a-brief-intro-to-my-research</a> on July 10th, 2022</p>",

At the time of the call for papers (2019, the conference originally was planned in 2020, but it was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic), my research was at a very early stages. The very first poster I submitted was still very vague in its approach, but as in 2020 I definitely move to the UK, I decided to focus the research on the observation of local maker communities. Because of health restrictions in place in 2021, I attended the conference online, where I presented my early plans for my research in the dedicated poster section. </p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"align-center\">To cite this work:</p>\n<p class=\"sqsrte-small align-center\">Fasoli, A.
