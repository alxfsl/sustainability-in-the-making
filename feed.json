Ceramicist Sarah Sullivan performing at the Green Maker Initiative Spring Event, Make Southwest.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    Sustainability in the Making is a PhD project that explores how craft and making contribute in building cultures of sustainability. \n<br>Cultures of sustainability are collective systems of knowledge and customs rooted in environmental and ecological values, which allow both individuals and communities to adopt more environmentally-friendly behaviours, lifestyles, and norms.\n<br>Many studies on sustainable craft focus on the way makers embody sustainability in their creative process: for example how they use recycled or upcycled materials, create artefacts using local resources, or make objects with specific sustainable purposes. This PhD, however, looks at sustainable craft from a different perspective, which sees craft and making as social activities through which people share, transform, and create cultural values, like preserving traditions, building local identities, sharing worldviews, creating a sense of place or collective histories.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/heritage-craft-bovey-tracey-1.webp\" height=\"2149\" width=\"1608\" alt=\"Watercolour and ink drawing of a man weaving a willow basket\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/heritage-craft-bovey-tracey-1-xs.webp 300w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/heritage-craft-bovey-tracey-1-sm.webp 480w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/heritage-craft-bovey-tracey-1-md.webp 768w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/heritage-craft-bovey-tracey-1-xl.webp 1200w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/heritage-craft-bovey-tracey-1-xxl.webp 1600w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/heritage-craft-bovey-tracey-1-xxxl.webp 1920w\">\n      <figcaption>Alessandra Fasoli © 2023.

Maker craft communities in Devon and the Southwest are fluid, active, and resilient communities, whose connection with the territory runs deep.  I decided then to take a broader social and cultural perspective, which led to the current title and approach&nbsp;<em>Sustainability in the Making: Craft Programmes for Socio-Ecological Change</em>.&nbsp;It looks more broadly at craft-led sustainability initiatives and programmes in the Southwest, which may or may not be also makerspace-based or makerspace-driven. \n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/makerspace.webp\" height=\"1079\" width=\"1417\" alt=\"Digital drawing of people working in a makerspace\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/makerspace-xs.webp 300w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/makerspace-sm.webp 480w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/makerspace-md.webp 768w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/makerspace-xl.webp 1200w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/makerspace-xxl.webp 1600w ,https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/18/responsive/makerspace-xxxl.webp 1920w\">\n      <figcaption>Alessandra Fasoli © 2020.

It explores how cultures of making contribute to social sustainability and aims to gain insights for community craft-led initiatives to be actively integrated in sustainability policies. </p>\n<p>This research expands <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14606925.2017.1352819\">my previous studies about the social role of makerspaces</a>, sometimes called hackerspaces or fab labs, which are a network of community open workshops that emerged and spread globally since the 2000s. Their dissemination generated a maker movement based on sharing tools, knowledge, and practices. Although they might not have an explicit sustainability mission, makerspace communities promote DIY practices, repairability, recycling, and reuse of objects, while the adoption of digital fabrication technologies like 3d printing or CNC milling machines led to the concept of <em><a href=\"https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/the-factory-everywhere-the-present-and-future-of-distributed-manufacturing/\">distributed manufacturing</a></em>, which advocates for a more local and custom production of objects.<br>Being often described as revolutionary and breakthrough, these approaches focus on products and production by answering the questions on <em>how</em> and <em>where</em> things are made, but leave aside <em>why</em> and <em>what</em> things are made, that instead inquiry the cultural significance of artefacts. Culture plays a crucial role in sustainability, as they inform behaviours, consumers’ choices, and production systems. In mass manufactured products and production, cultural values are mostly hidden: like for example, in a cheap sweater. They however become evident in craft objects, like a hand-knitted jumper by your mum, where the value of the family relationship is transferred and embedded in the jumper, and the time, care, and inventiveness in creating it give to the artefact a special meaning.</p>\n<p>Craft practices have then retained a cultural affection and reconnect us with the material world in a more direct, sometimes nostalgic, way. <a href=\"https://www.craftscouncil.org.uk/learning/participation/what-we-learned-from-co-creating-in-makerspaces\">Makerspaces gave craft a new opportunity</a> to claim back its social dimension through public engagement in making, increased using digital platforms. In both physical and digital maker communities it is the practice of making, not artefacts, that is shaping and strengthening the relationship between the members of these communities, and between communities and their environment. Considering its shared cultural value, craft can then be an important tool to create sustainability cultures. </p>\n<p>After a first stage of exploring the cultural meaning of craft, makerspaces, and social sustainability, my project is now investigating what <em>craft in makerspaces</em> means for communities in Devon, where I live, and where there is an active sustainability-oriented maker tradition. This is a participatory process through which the local maker communities are actively helping me to build a map of Devon making ecologies and understand how they are contributing to enhance a social sustainable behaviour. \nHowever, for craft practices to have a meaningful impact in building environmental cultures, they need to be integrated into more structural sustainability strategies. The final goal of this project is to have an outcome that points in this direction, a toolkit for stakeholders to promote and improve craft-led sustainability change.</p>\n<p><em>A <a href=\"https://www.craftscouncil.org.uk/about/research-and-policy/march-2022/craft-in-makerspaces\">shorter version</a> of this article has been featured in the Crafts Council’s Research Updates in March 2022.</em></p>\n",

The very first poster I submitted was still very vague in its approach, but as in 2020 I definitely move to the UK, I decided to focus the research on the observation of local maker communities.
