In this document you will find information about this study and its overarching PhD research: what are the goals, how the study is conducted, and what taking part does and does not involve. Please read it carefully.</p><p>In the final section you can find further resources about the PhD and contact details for any clarification, question, or doubt.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1hc2h77id28">Brief summary</h3><h4 id="mcetoc_1hc29u8b421"></h4><p><em>The Art of Crafting Sustainability</em> is a visual and artistic ethnographic study that investigates how maker initiatives in Devon and the Southwest are promoting and building sustainability behaviours and ecological cultures.<br>The study is part of the PhD project <em>Sustainability in the Making: Craft Programmes for Eco-Social Change</em>, a doctoral research that explores how craft and making contribute to generate and promote <em>culture(s) of sustainability</em>. This PhD is a doctoral training partnership by Kingston University - Kingston School of Art (academic partner) and the Crafts Council UK (non-academic partner), and it is sponsored by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) Techne. This study is conducted by Alessandra (Alex) Fasoli, author of this document and PhD candidate in charge of the project.</p><h4 id="about-this-phd">About this PhD</h4><p>This PhD focuses on how cultures of sustainability can be generated and promoted through craft and maker programmes.<br><em>Cultures of sustainability</em> are collective systems of knowledge and customs rooted in environmental and ecological values, which allow individuals and communities to adopt more environmentally-friendly behaviours, lifestyles, and norms. Many studies on <em>sustainable craft</em> focus on the way makers incorporate sustainability in their creative process: for example how they use recycled or upcycled materials, create artefacts using local resources, or make objects with specific sustainable purposes.<br>This PhD, however, looks at <em>sustainable craft</em> from a different perspective, which sees craft and making as social activities through which people share, transform, and create cultural values, like preserving traditions, building local identities, sharing worldviews, creating a sense of place or shaping collective histories. Combining this definition of craft as a cultural tool and the concept of cultures of sustainability, this PhD asks if and how craft can be a vehicle to build sustainability cultures and aims to answer this question by studying existing craft programmes that promote specific environmental, ecological, and sustainable approaches through making.</p><h4 id="what-is-the-art-of-crafting-sustainability-study-about">What is the <em>Art of Crafting Sustainability</em> study about?</h4><p><em>The Art of Crafting Sustainability</em> is an ethnographic study based on participant observation, that uses <em>observational sketching</em> as its primary tool for gathering data. <em>Observational sketching</em> is a research method in which the researcher observing a groups uses drawing and sketches as its primary form of notetaking and data management. Alex, the researcher conducting the study, will join your event as an observant researcher and will draw on a sketchbook what she is observing.</p><h4 id="what-drawings-will-she-make">What drawings will she make?</h4><p>During her observation, Alex will be producing a variety of sketches that can be focused on a particular individual (figure 1, figure 2 left, figure 3 left); on a group (figure 2 right); and/or on a particular interaction (figure 3 right).</p><figure><img loading="lazy" title="Figure 1.

Alex might also add written notes and quotes to her drawings (figure 1).</p><h4 id="whats-involved-in-taking-part-in-the-study">What’s involved in taking part in the study?</h4><p>The objective of this study is to understand which cultural dynamics are generated during maker- and craft-led events and to observe how engaging with sustainable making allows people to reflect and learn about the environment, the climate crisis, consumerism, and production. Participants in these events should carry on their activities as normal while Alex is observing them. She will interfere as little as possible, not to alter spontaneous behaviours with her own perspective.</p><h4 id="will-there-also-be-interviews">Will there also be interviews?</h4><p>Interviews are not part of this study, but conversations between participants and the researcher might happen. Alex might engage in conversations or ask specific questions after the observational work is concluded. Spontaneous conversations during the observational sketching are welcome, but the possible use of these conversations in the research study will be discussed and negotiated with participants on a case-by-case basis. However, Alex will arrange a small conversation before and after the event with workshop/event leaders, as they can give more insights of the activity (objectives, goals, impressions, comparisons with other iterations) and help contextualise it. These conversations will be recorded and used in the study following a previous agreement.</p><h4 id="are-there-other-initiatives-that-will-take-part-in-the-research">Are there other initiatives that will take part in the research?</h4><p>The research focuses on sustainable craft programmes in Devon and the Southwest. This study will be carried in several craft events and workshops in the area that have a sustainability approach.</p><h4 id="you-agree-for-me-to-join-you-during-your-eventworkshop.can-participants-opt-out">You agree for me to join you during your event/workshop. Can participants opt out?</h4><p>Participation is voluntary. If someone participating in your event does not want to be involved in the study, the person will not be observed, meaning that there will be no sketches/drawings of them nor the researcher will collect any data about them. Participants who initially agreed to take part can opt out in any moment, meaning that they can withdraw their participation in the middle, at the end, or up to 20 days after the event; any sketches and drawings in which they could be identified will not be used; and any personal data concerning them will be destroyed or deleted.<br>If you are a workshop/event leader and want to withdraw from the study, this decision must be communicated before the event takes place. If Alex has already participated in the event, you can contact her within 20 days to anonymise the case study, meaning the name of the workshop/event and other identifiable data (comprised identifiable data of the leader)will be removed from the dataset. You can find more information on anonymity and confidentiality in the ‘Data’ section of this document. Group sketches and drawing or stylised sketches (figure 5) with no quotes or references to specific participants are conceptual, therefore Alex reserves the right to use them if she deems them valuable for the study. This applies to all conceptual sketches whose primary function is a general representation of a collective occurrence.</p><p> </p><p>Figure 5. Alessandra Fasoli, 2023.

She might take pictures of herself during the act of drawing (or ask someone to). These are documentation photos that are meant to show the methodology in action. This study does not comprise other types of documentary visuals (portrait photos, videos) beyond drawings. Previous consent by the participant, Alex might record casual conversations between participants, and between them and her.

Sketches and drawing can be presented as standalone pictures or paired with quotes through audio files and texts. The online showcase is built along the study, and its latest release can be found at <a href="http://www.sustainabilityinthemaking.com/">https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com</a>.<br>There you can find more information about the online showcase as a research tool for this project.</p><p>As part of a PhD, data and information generated by this study will analysed and discussed in the final dissertation, the primary output of the research. Datasets that will accompany the final dissertation will be aggregated data containing only the relevant information used in the research. Sensitive and confidential data will not be included in the dataset.</p><p>Finally, drawings, audio files, and data analysis can be presented in conferences and public talks, in person and online, in the form of digital presentations, installations, or videos. They can be part of exhibitions in galleries and public venues, and they can be published and printed in academic and non-academic manuscripts, in the form of scientific articles, essays, blogs, or books.</p><h3 id="contacts">Contacts</h3><p>Please use the contacts below if you want any further information on this study</p><h4 id="principal-researcher">Principal Researcher</h4><p>Alessandra Fasoli<br>Postgraduate Researcher in Sustainable Design<br>email: <a href="mailto:a.fasoli@kingston.ac.uk">a.fasoli@kingston.ac.uk</a><br>Kingston University London | Kingston School of Art<br>School of Creative and Cultural Industries, School of Design Department of Critical and Historical Studies<br>Knights Park Grange Road,<br>Kingston upon Thames,<br>Surrey KT1 2QJ</p><h4 id="current-supervisory-team">Current Supervisory Team</h4><p><strong>First supervisor</strong> <br>Dr Paul Micklethwaite, Kingston University London<br><strong>Second supervisor</strong> <br>Professor Daniel Charny MBE, Kingston University London<br><strong>Non-academic supervisor</strong> <br>Joanne Haywood, Crafts Council education manager</p><h4 id="university-contact-for-clarification-or-complaints-about-this-research">University contact for clarification or complaints about this research</h4><p>Mandi Ure</p><h4 id="funding">Funding</h4><p>Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) Techne Doctoral Training Partnership</p><h4 id="university">University</h4><p>Kingston University London</p><h4 id="non-academic-partner">Non-academic Partner</h4><p>Crafts Council UK</p><h3 id="further-supporting-information">Further supporting information</h3><p>More information about this project, its evolution, the methodology and the philosophy of the research are available online at: <a href="http://www.sustainabilityinthemaking.com/">https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com</a></p><p>The website is both a showcase of the research and a resource for participants and the public to find more information about the research findings, and links to the initiatives and people I have been working with.</p><h3 id="version-control">Version control</h3><p>Version #2 – 05/10/2023</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__updated-share"><div class="post__updated">Updated: <time datetime="2023-10-06T14:03">October 6, 2023</time></div><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]"><svg width="32" height="32"><use xlink:href="https://alxfsl.github.io/sustainability-in-the-making/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="post__author"><div><h3><a href="https://alxfsl.github.io/sustainability-in-the-making/authors/alessandra-fasoli/" rel="author">Alessandra Fasoli</a></h3><p>I'm a design researcher and a PhD candidate at Kingston School of Art, London. <em>Sustainability in the Making</em> is my craft-based PhD where I am trying to grasp how cultures of sustainability are generated through collective craft, through my craft: drawing and web design.
