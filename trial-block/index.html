This study is conducted by Alessandra (Alex) Fasoli, author of this document and PhD candidate in charge of the project.</p><br><p></p><h2 id="about-this-phdlessbrgreater">About this PhD<br></h2><p></p><p>This PhD focuses on how cultures of sustainability can be generated and promoted through craft and maker programmes.<br><br><em>Cultures of sustainability</em> are collective systems of knowledge and customs rooted in environmental and ecological values, which allow individuals and communities to adopt more environmentally-friendly behaviours, lifestyles, and norms.<br>Many studies on <em>sustainable craft</em> focus on the way makers incorporate sustainability in their creative process: for example how they use recycled or upcycled materials, create artefacts using local resources, or make objects with specific sustainable purposes.<br><br>This PhD, however, looks at <em>sustainable craft</em> from a different perspective, which sees craft and making as social activities through which people share, transform, and create cultural values, like preserving traditions, building local identities, sharing worldviews, creating a sense of place, or shaping collective histories. Combining this definition of craft as a cultural tool and the concept of cultures of sustainability, this PhD asks if and how craft can be a vehicle to build sustainability cultures and aims to answer this question by studying existing craft programmes that promote specific environmental, ecological, and sustainable approaches through making. This PhD looks specifically at craft initiatives in Devon and Southwest England.</p><br><p></p><h2 id="what-is-the-study-art-of-crafting-sustainability-aboutlessbrgreater">What is the study Art of Crafting Sustainability about?<br></h2><p></p><p><em>The Art of Crafting Sustainability</em> is an ethnographic study based on participant observation, that uses <em>observational sketching</em> as its primary tool for gathering data. <em>Observational sketching</em> is a research method in which the researcher observing a specific group or phenomenon uses drawing and sketches as its primary form of notetaking and data management.<br>Alex, the researcher conducting the study, will join your event as an observant researcher and will draw on a sketchbook what she is observing.</p><br><p></p><h3 id="what-drawings-will-she-makelessbrgreater">What drawings will she make?<br></h3><p>During her observation, Alex will be producing a variety of sketches that can be focused on a particular individual (figure 1, figure 2 left, figure 3 left); on a group (figure 2 right); and/or on a particular interaction (figure 3 right).</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/15/sarah_hero_cover.webp" height="1440" width="2560" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/15/responsive/sarah_hero_cover-xs.webp 300w, https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/15/responsive/sarah_hero_cover-sm.webp 480w, https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/15/responsive/sarah_hero_cover-md.webp 768w, https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/15/responsive/sarah_hero_cover-xl.webp 1200w, https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/15/responsive/sarah_hero_cover-xxl.webp 1600w, https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/15/responsive/sarah_hero_cover-xxxl.webp 1920w"><figcaption>Figure 1.

Sarah Sullivan is a ceramicist from Cornwall and a member of the Green Maker Initiative (GMI) by MAKE Southwest. This drawing was made during her performance at the GMI event in Spring 2023 at MAKE Southwest gallery in Bovey Tracey. While I was drawing her, we engaged in a conversation and Sarah told me about her philosophy on pottery and why she chose to become a pottery maker. The handwritten notes are quotes from our conversation.

Alex might also add written notes and quotes to her drawings (figure 1).</p><br><p></p><h2 id="whats-involved-in-taking-part-in-the-studylessbrgreater">What’s involved in taking part in the study?<br></h2><p></p><p>The objective of this study is to understand which cultural dynamics are generated during maker- and craft-led events and to observe how engaging with sustainable making allows people to reflect and learn about the environment, the climate crisis, consumerism, and production. Participants in these events should carry on their activities as normal while Alex is observing them. She will interfere as little as possible, not to alter spontaneous behaviours with her own perspective.</p><br><p></p><h3 id="will-there-also-be-interviews">Will there also be interviews?</h3><p></p><p>Interviews are not part of this study, but conversations between participants and the researcher might happen. Alex might engage in conversations or ask specific questions after the observational work is concluded. Spontaneous conversations during the observational sketching are welcome, but the possible use of these conversations in the research study will be discussed and negotiated with participants on a case-by-case basis.<br>However, Alex will arrange a small conversation before and after the event with workshop/event leaders, as they can give more insights of the activity (objectives, goals, impressions, comparisons with other iterations) and help contextualise it. These conversations will be recorded and used in the study following a previous agreement.</p><br><p></p><h3 id="are-there-other-initiatives-that-will-take-part-in-the-researchlessbrgreater">Are there other initiatives that will take part in the research?<br></h3><p></p><p>The research focuses on sustainable craft programmes in Devon and the Southwest. This study will be carried in several craft events and workshops in the area that have a sustainability approach.</p><br><p></p><h3 id="you-agree-for-me-to-join-you-during-your-eventworkshop-can-participants-opt-outlessbrgreater">You agree for me to join you during your event/workshop. Can participants opt out?<br></h3><p></p><p>Participation is voluntary. If someone participating in your event does not want to be involved in the study, the person will not be observed, meaning that there will be no sketches/drawings of them nor the researcher will collect any data about them. Participants who initially agreed to take part can withdraw their participation in the middle, at the end, or up to 20 days after the event; any sketches and drawings in which they could be identified will not be used; and any personal data collected concerning them will be destroyed and/or deleted.<br><br>If you are a workshop/event leader and want to withdraw from the study, this decision must be communicated before the event takes place. If Alex has already participated in the event, you can contact her within 20 days to anonymise the conversations you had with her and, when possible, the case study. You can find more information on anonymity and confidentiality in the ‘Data’ section of this document.<br>Group sketches and drawing or stylised sketches (figure 5) with no quotes or references to specific participants are conceptual, therefore Alex reserves the right to use them if she deems them valuable for the study. This applies to all conceptual sketches whose primary function is a general representation of a collective occurrence.</p><br><p>Figure 5. Alessandra Fasoli, 2023.

She might take pictures of herself during the act of drawing (or ask someone to). These are documentation photos that are meant to show the methodology in action.
