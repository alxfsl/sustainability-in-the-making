This study is conducted by Alessandra (Alex) Fasoli, author of this document and PhD candidate in charge of the project.</p><h2 id="about-this-phdlessbrgreater">About this PhD<br></h2><p>This PhD focuses on how cultures of sustainability can be generated and promoted through craft and maker programmes.<br><i>Cultures of sustainability&nbsp;</i>are collective systems of knowledge and customs rooted in environmental and ecological values, which allow individuals and communities to adopt more environmentally-friendly behaviours, lifestyles, and norms.<br>Many studies on *sustainable craft* focus on the way makers incorporate sustainability in their creative process: for example how they use recycled or upcycled materials, create artefacts using local resources, or make objects with specific sustainable purposes.<br>This PhD, however, looks at <i>sustainable craft&nbsp;</i>from a different perspective, which sees craft and making as social activities through which people share, transform, and create cultural values, like preserving traditions, building local identities, sharing worldviews, creating a sense of place, or shaping collective histories. Combining this definition of craft as a cultural tool and the concept of cultures of sustainability, this PhD asks in which ways craft contributes to build sustainability cultures and aims to answer this question by studying existing craft programmes that promote specific environmental, ecological, and sustainable approaches through making. This PhD focuses on craft initiatives in Devon and Southwest England.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-studyandnbsplessigreaterthe-art-of-crafting-sustainabilitylessigreaterandnbspabout">What is the study&nbsp;<i>The Art of Crafting Sustainability</i>&nbsp;about?</h2><p><i>The Art of Crafting Sustainability</i>&nbsp;is an ethnographic study based on participant observation, that uses <i>observational sketching</i>&nbsp;as its primary tool for gathering data. <i>Observational sketching</i>&nbsp;is a research method in which the researcher observing a specific group or phenomenon uses drawing and sketches as its primary form of notetaking and data gathering.<br>I, Alex, the researcher conducting the study, will join your event as an observant researcher and will draw on a sketchbook what I observe.</p><h3 id="what-drawings-will-i-make">What drawings will I make?</h3><div><p>During my observation, I will be producing a variety of sketches that can be focused on a particular individual (figure 1, figure 2 left, figure 3 left); on a group (figure 2 right); and/or on a particular interaction (figure 3 right).<br>As the idea is to graphically describe the dynamics and relationships happening throughout the whole event, on-site drawings can be simple pencil or ink line sketches (figure 4) with colour added later (figure 1, 2, and 3). I might add written notes and quotes (figure 1).</p></div><figure id="figure-1" class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/17/230520_GMI_Sarah_web.jpg" height="2481" width="3508" alt="Watercolour drawing of a blonde woman doing pottery with handwritten notes and watercolours splashes" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/17/responsive/230520_GMI_Sarah_web-xs.webp 300w, https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/17/responsive/230520_GMI_Sarah_web-sm.webp 480w, https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/17/responsive/230520_GMI_Sarah_web-md.webp 768w, https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/17/responsive/230520_GMI_Sarah_web-xl.webp 1200w, https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/17/responsive/230520_GMI_Sarah_web-xxl.webp 1600w, https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/17/responsive/230520_GMI_Sarah_web-xxxl.webp 1920w"><figcaption>Figure 1.

Participants in these events should carry on their activities as normal while I am observing them. I will interfere as little as possible, not to alter spontaneous behaviours with my own perspective.</p><h3 id="will-there-also-be-interviews">Will there also be interviews?</h3><p>Interviews are not part of this study, but conversations between participants and the researcher might happen. I might engage in conversations or ask specific questions after the observational work is concluded. Spontaneous conversations during the observational sketching are welcome, but the possible use of these conversations in the research study will be discussed and negotiated with participants on a case-by-case basis.<br>However, I will arrange a small conversation before and after the event with workshop/event leaders, as they can give more insights of the activity (objectives, goals, impressions, comparisons with other iterations) and help contextualise it. These conversations will be recorded and used in the study following a previous agreement.</p><h3 id="are-there-other-initiatives-that-will-take-part-in-the-research">Are there other initiatives that will take part in the research?</h3><p>The research focuses on sustainable craft programmes in Devon and the Southwest. This study will be carried in several craft events and workshops in the area that have a sustainability approach.</p><h3 id="you-agree-for-me-to-join-you-during-your-eventworkshop-can-participants-opt-out">You agree for me to join you during your event/workshop. Can participants opt out?</h3><p>Participation is voluntary. If someone participating in your event does not want to be involved in the study, they can communicate it orally at the beginning of, during, and at the end of the observational activity: the person will not be observed, meaning that I will not sketch/draw them nor collect any data about them. Participants who initially agreed to take part can withdraw their participation in the middle, at the end, or up to 20 days after the event by verbally communicate they withdrawal or by sending an email with their identification data to a.fasoli@kingston.ac.uk: any sketches and drawings in which they could be identified will not be used in the study; and any personal data collected concerning them will be destroyed and/or deleted.<br>If you are a workshop/event leader and want to withdraw from the study, this decision must be communicated before the event takes place. If I already participated in the event, you can contact me via email or phone within 20 days to anonymise your event, and our before and after conversations will be excluded from the study. All identifiable drawings of you will not be used in the study. You can find more information on anonymity and confidentiality in the 'Data' section of this document.<br>Group sketches and drawing or stylised sketches (figure 5) with no quotes or references to specific participants are conceptual, therefore I reserves the right to use them if I deems them valuable for the study. This applies to all conceptual sketches whose primary function is a general representation of a collective occurrence.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/17/230609_Craft-Festival-Bovey-Tracey-5.png" height="2268" width="4032" alt="Picture of an open sketchbook.
