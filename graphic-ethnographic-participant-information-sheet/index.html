This study is conducted by Alessandra (Alex) Fasoli, author of this document and PhD candidate in charge of the project.</p><h2 id="about-this-phdlessbrgreater">About this PhD<br></h2><p>This PhD focuses on how cultures of sustainability can be generated and promoted through craft and maker programmes.<br><i>Cultures of sustainability&nbsp;</i>are collective systems of knowledge and customs rooted in environmental and ecological values, which allow individuals and communities to adopt more environmentally-friendly behaviours, lifestyles, and norms.<br>Many studies on *sustainable craft* focus on the way makers incorporate sustainability in their creative process: for example how they use recycled or upcycled materials, create artefacts using local resources, or make objects with specific sustainable purposes.<br>This PhD, however, looks at <i>sustainable craft&nbsp;</i>from a different perspective, which sees craft and making as social activities through which people share, transform, and create cultural values, like preserving traditions, building local identities, sharing worldviews, creating a sense of place, or shaping collective histories. Combining this definition of craft as a cultural tool and the concept of cultures of sustainability, this PhD asks in which ways craft contributes to build sustainability cultures and aims to answer this question by studying existing craft programmes that promote specific environmental, ecological, and sustainable approaches through making. This PhD focuses on craft initiatives in Devon and Southwest England.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-studyandnbsplessigreaterthe-art-of-crafting-sustainabilitylessigreaterandnbspabout">What is the study&nbsp;<i>The Art of Crafting Sustainability</i>&nbsp;about?</h2><p><i>The Art of Crafting Sustainability</i>&nbsp;is an ethnographic study based on participant observation, that uses <i>observational sketching</i>&nbsp;as its primary tool for gathering data. <i>Observational sketching</i>&nbsp;is a research method in which the researcher observing a specific group or phenomenon uses drawing and sketches as its primary form of notetaking and data gathering.<br>I, Alex, the researcher conducting the study, will join your event as an observant researcher and will draw on a sketchbook what I observe.</p><h3 id="what-drawings-will-i-make">What drawings will I make?</h3><div><p>During my observation, I will be producing a variety of sketches that can be focused on a particular individual (<a href="figure-1">figure 1</a>, <a href="figure-2">figure 2 left</a>, <a href="figure-3">figure 3 left</a>); on a group (figure 2 right); and/or on a particular interaction (figure 3 right).<br>As the idea is to graphically describe the dynamics and relationships happening throughout the whole event, on-site drawings can be simple pencil or ink line sketches (figure 4) with colour added later (figure 1, 2, and 3). I might add written notes and quotes (figure 1).</p></div><figure id="figure-1" class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/17/230520_GMI_Sarah_web.jpg" height="2481" width="3508" alt="Watercolour drawing of a blonde woman doing pottery with handwritten notes and watercolours spashes" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/17/responsive/230520_GMI_Sarah_web-xs.webp 300w, https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/17/responsive/230520_GMI_Sarah_web-sm.webp 480w, https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/17/responsive/230520_GMI_Sarah_web-md.webp 768w, https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/17/responsive/230520_GMI_Sarah_web-xl.webp 1200w, https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/17/responsive/230520_GMI_Sarah_web-xxl.webp 1600w, https://sustainabilityinthemaking.com/media/posts/17/responsive/230520_GMI_Sarah_web-xxxl.webp 1920w"><figcaption>Figure 1.
